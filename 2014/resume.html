            <p>I am a hyperactive software genius!</p>
            <p>Over the past 6 years in the profession, I have had the chance to work on everything from wiring cable at layer 1 all the way up to building applications at layer 7. While I do claim the title of "genius" I do not use the default interpretation. In my life experience I have noticed many believe genius' are smart while in fact it is about intelligence. I cannot claim to know everything but I will claim that I can learn anything at a highly accelerated rate.</p>
            <p>Growing up with untreated ADHD caused me to develop some coping mechanisms; software was a haven from the overwhelming world around me. This flaw of mine in the everyday world has since turned into a giant merit in the software industry. I always strive to architect, build, provision, code and deploy in the most optimal way within the bounds of my knowledge. And physics, of course. Though if I can do better and there is time I always try to build the best and eliminate technical debt on every layer.</p>
            <p>Since beginning treatment my ability has skyrocketed; I try to read a new technical article on a daily basis as well as architect or work on a new idea. I also have become a lot more aware of myself and I have been working to turn each flaw into a new merit. The road has been tough and I look to my career and the systems I work with to help me learn organically, through my day-to-day life. I build meta concepts about communication and the people I interact with to help me be a better contributor to society whilst understanding the world better.</p>
            <p>I live to code. If my skills and my person sound intriguing then I would love to talk with you.</p>
            <p>My long term 10 year goal is to accrue enough experience and connections to start and run my own company.</p>

            <h3><a name="philosophy"></a>Philosophy</h3>
            <p>No one is perfect and everyone has baggage; this is something no one in our world can deny. I believe that honesty is the best policy. I'm a firm believer in our freedoms, especially the freedom of speech; however, with all freedoms they must be exercised in moderation. Because of this and my placement of importance on honesty, I will always be upfront and direct because there is a reason for everything and we are all human we make mistakes and sometimes do not think things through. This happens both in the scope of personal issues and the importance we place on our careers. I know that was a long lead in for my primary philosophy.</p>
            <blockquote>... Because this life is yours. Some of it was given to you, the rest you make yourself.</blockquote>
            <p>This statement paints a beautiful picture of how I view life and my career. I'm not perfect both due to situational circumstances of my past and present but I have the power to change and be different.</p>

                  <span class="heading">Details</span>
                  <p>At Jiff I was responsible for the Rails Platform. I was part of a team of 4 total engineers; made of up of our Lead Engineer, another Sr. Engineer, a Jr. Engineer and Me.</p>
                  <p>We were constantly working on making our Ruby backend to be more responsive and more optimized. Our long term goal was to reorganize our platform code to be more fit for a Service Oriented Architecture. We started by optimizing our pain points that used heavy queries, duplicated code and overly complex data models. Then we spent time determining which components were specific to services we offered; then the hacking began and I mean literal hacking we cut out close to 75% of the code base and we still had more to go when I left.</p>
                  <p>One of the solutions we were using to migrate to SOA so that our services could run independently of the platform was called "gemification". While the idea was the team's, I was given the honor to come up with the architecture and implementation process; which was subjected to a through peer review by the Platform, API and QA teams. This process included a write up, prototype and benchmark. I then helped guide the each team member in ensuring that we were consistent with our decided plan and did not deviate without a proper meeting; a common issue at Jiff.</p>
                  <p>Along side this plan, I proposed a PaaS server architecture using Amazon VPC, EC2 and Docker.IO with Bind9 Dynamic DNS for service discovery. There was much team backing and there was even time that was allocated to the implementation process as well as a working prototype. Unfortunately our new VP of Engineering had cancelled the project before it's completion.</p>
                  <p>Along side gemification I was a huge advocate for taking non-company critical code and releasing it open source. We released 2 gems during my duration at Jiff, unfortunately there was not enough time to properly document them to my satisfaction. Upon being let go I forked them and plan to continue development on them.</p>

                  <p>Youmacon was my first <u>real</u> big job. I had been doing some small jobs writing custom Content and Customer Relation Management Systems for years. I was approached to architect, build, deploy and manage a ticket sales application for a ~5,000 person convention. I jumped on the opportunity and proved myself very quickly.</p>
                  <p>The initial system was really nothing special. It was built from scraps of my old projects and had a really bad design, but it was functional. It integrated with the PayPal SOAP Api to process the ticket sales while providing a backend that could be used to handle refunds, complimentary tickets and discounts.</p>
                  <p>Over the years it started becoming a platform and I modualarized all the components, bought the rights, contracted it back to them and named it ¥ENN rEvolution. The new platform had so much more; it had gifting, stripe integration, convention staff management, and newsletter aggregation to get our attendees all excited for the upcoming year (using Amazon SES). It was and still slightly is one of my biggest prides.</p>
                  <p>The platform was built on EvolutionSDK V3; the same framework built by the teams at Verschoyle and Momentum OS, I felt since it was a framework I thoroughly understood it would be the best for the job, and it was amazing running on top of PHP-FPM and Nginx.</p>
                  <p>I resigned in December 2013 as the convention grew so large I was no longer able to manage the pre-registration and since the convention has primarily volunteer staff I was not able to consistently get help. Though depending, since I know they need it and the Chairman won't stop asking me, I may go to the convention and run his registration department on site like I had been. He usually needs someone dedicated and loyal to his business needs to help put out the fires.</p>

                     <span>Since Kelly's introduction to my staff, my event has advanced far beyond its previous scope through the systems she developed for us. With these systems, we can process information and registrations with far greater efficiency and efficacy. Thanks to her efforts, our capabilities are far greater than those of our competitors, and our event has greatly expanded as a whole.</span>
