            <h3>Cover Letter</h3><p>I am a hyperactive software genius!
Over the past 6 years in the profession, I have had the chance to work on everything from wiring cable at layer 1 all the way up to building applications at layer 7. While I do claim the title of &#34;genius&#34; I do not use the default interpretation. In my life experience I have noticed many believe genius&#39; are smart while in fact it is about intelligence. I cannot claim to know everything but I will claim that I can learn anything at a highly accelerated rate.
Growing up with untreated ADHD caused me to develop some coping mechanisms; software was a haven from the overwhelming world around me. This flaw of mine in the everyday world has since turned into a giant merit in the software industry. I always strive to architect, build, provision, code and deploy in the most optimal way within the bounds of my knowledge. And physics, of course. Though if I can do better and there is time I always try to build the best and eliminate technical debt on every layer.
Since beginning treatment my ability has skyrocketed; I try to read a new technical article on a daily basis as well as architect or work on a new idea. I also have become a lot more aware of myself and I have been working to turn each flaw into a new merit. The road has been tough and I look to my career and the systems I work with to help me learn organically, through my day-to-day life. I build meta concepts about communication and the people I interact with to help me be a better contributor to society whilst understanding the world better.
I live to code. If my skills and my person sound intriguing then I would love to talk with you.
My long term 10 year goal is to accrue enough experience and connections to start and run my own company.</p>

            <h3>Work / Life Philosophy</h3><p>No one is perfect and everyone has baggage; this is something no one in our world can deny. I believe that honesty is the best policy. I&#39;m a firm believer in our freedoms, especially the freedom of speech; however, with all freedoms they must be exercised in moderation. Because of this and my placement of importance on honesty, I will always be upfront and direct because there is a reason for everything and we are all human we make mistakes and sometimes do not think things through. This happens both in the scope of personal issues and the importance we place on our careers. I know that was a long lead in for my primary philosophy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... Because this life is yours. Some of it was given to you, the rest you make yourself.
This statement paints a beautiful picture of how I view life and my career. I&#39;m not perfect both due to situational circumstances of my past and present but I have the power to change and be different.</p>

                <div class="info details"><span class="heading">Details</span><p>At Jiff I was responsible for the Rails Platform. I was part of a team of 4 total engineers; made of up of our Lead Engineer, another Sr. Engineer, a Jr. Engineer and Me.</p>
<p>We were constantly working on making our Ruby backend to be more responsive and more optimized. Our long term goal was to reorganize our platform code to be more fit for a Service Oriented Architecture. We started by optimizing our pain points that used heavy queries, duplicated code and overly complex data models. Then we spent time determining which components were specific to services we offered; then the hacking began and I mean literal hacking we cut out close to 75% of the code base and we still had more to go when I left.</p>
<p>One of the solutions we were using to migrate to SOA so that our services could run independently of the platform was called &#34;gemification&#34;. While the idea was the team&#39;s, I was given the honor to come up with the architecture and implementation process; which was subjected to a through peer review by the Platform, API and QA teams. This process included a write up, prototype and benchmark. I then helped guide the each team member in ensuring that we were consistent with our decided plan and did not deviate without a proper meeting; a common issue at Jiff.</p>
<p>Along side this plan, I proposed a PaaS server architecture using Amazon VPC, EC2 and Docker.IO with Bind9 Dynamic DNS for service discovery. There was much team backing and there was even time that was allocated to the implementation process as well as a working prototype. Unfortunately our new VP of Engineering had cancelled the project before it&#39;s completion.</p>
<p>Along side gemification I was a huge advocate for taking non-company critical code and releasing it open source. We released 2 gems during my duration at Jiff, unfortunately there was not enough time to properly document them to my satisfaction. Upon being let go I forked them and plan to continue development on them.</p>
