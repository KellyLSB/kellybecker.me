            <h3>Cover Letter</h3><p>I am a hyperactive software genius! Over the past 6 years in the profession, I have had the chance to work on everything from wiring cable at layer 1 all the way up to building applications at layer 7. While I do claim the title of &#34;genius&#34; I do not use the default interpretation. In my life experience I have noticed many believe genius&#39; are smart while in fact it is about intelligence. I cannot claim to know everything but I will claim that I can learn anything at a highly accelerated rate. Growing up with untreated ADHD caused me to develop some coping mechanisms; software was a haven from the overwhelming world around me. This flaw of mine in the everyday world has since turned into a giant merit in the software industry. I always strive to architect, build, provision, code and deploy in the most optimal way within the bounds of my knowledge. And physics, of course. Though if I can do better and there is time I always try to build the best and eliminate technical debt on every layer. Since beginning treatment my ability has skyrocketed; I try to read a new technical article on a daily basis as well as architect or work on a new idea. I also have become a lot more aware of myself and I have been working to turn each flaw into a new merit. The road has been tough and I look to my career and the systems I work with to help me learn organically, through my day-to-day life. I build meta concepts about communication and the people I interact with to help me be a better contributor to society whilst understanding the world better. I live to code. If my skills and my person sound intriguing then I would love to talk with you. My long term 10 year goal is to accrue enough experience and connections to start and run my own company.</p>

The specs were out of date due to the fixtures, so there was also a lot of code that needed to be updated.</p>
<p>Once I had completed that project the remainder of my time was spent building a Cascading Hypervisor Fronted by Sinatra and Vagrant. We needed to have recylcable Windows Machines for our Mechanical Turk Users; so the machines only needed to live at a minimum of 15 - 20 minutes. Once we had the basic architecture working after finally settling on Softlater for hosting; I wrote a plugin for vagrant that captured the screen whenever I input was made from the user. This allowed us to verify the authenticity of their tests.</p>
<p>We also played around with a lot of new languages; like <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a>!</p>

Some of the company though I was part of client services the rest wanted me in engineering. My Title was &quot;Support Engineer&quot; so I was not so sure either.</p>
<p>I would up at first optimizing and writing new Hive queries for our Hadoop/Hive cluster. This involved adding new template builders to jQuery and a lot of patience (the queries on average took 20 minutes). Unfortunately there was no Test server... But we eventually got it to an exceptable point for the moment.</p>
<p>I Did a little work on the Rails Self-Service application, mostly front-end tweaks and a couple new API&#39;s on the backend. But not that much and all of if circled around the Hive Cluster....</p>
<p>I eventually got moved to Ops where I made my biggest impact. I cleaned up and organized all our Puppet Manifests and got it to the point where you could run it and it would not break. I also wrote a wrapper script that would take the NoOp data and format it so it was easily readable; It would compare it with other NoOps from similar servers and highlight dangerous tasks and discrepencies. It required to DevOps Engineers to approve the run if the run ran in more than one Data Center.</p>
<p>I also built a new router for the office to protect our engineering infrastructure in-house from our guest network and ensure it was locked down tight. I did this with a <a href="http://soekris.com/products/net5501.html">Soekris net5501</a> running <a href="https://www.pfsense.org">pfSense</a>.</p>

<p>Kelly is an incredible developer in PHP and more languages. At the time I hired Kelly, it was to create a from-scratch content management system to manage several college age small groups from our church. Kelly put together a site quickly that was better than the overall content manager of our church&#39;s entire website. It&#39;s still an incredible management tool, and that was 4 years ago with no upgrades. Kelly thinks forward when it comes to coding, and writes the simplest, most scalable web solutions. Kelly is the best coder I have ever worked with, and probably ever will, the way she stays ahead of the game

There are 5 categories though depending on the section you are viewing they should have different interpretations. Don&#39;t worry they are almost the same.</p>
