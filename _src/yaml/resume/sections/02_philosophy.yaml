      No one is perfect and everyone has baggage; this is something no one in our world can deny. I believe that honesty is the best policy. I&#39;m a firm believer in our freedoms, especially the freedom of speech; however, with all freedoms they must be exercised in moderation. Because of this and my placement of importance on honesty, I will always be upfront and direct because there is a reason for everything and we are all human we make mistakes and sometimes do not think things through. This happens both in the scope of personal issues and the importance we place on our careers. I know that was a long lead in for my primary philosophy.
      > ... Because this life is yours. Some of it was given to you, the rest you make yourself.
      This statement paints a beautiful picture of how I view life and my career. I&#39;m not perfect both due to situational circumstances of my past and present but I have the power to change and be different.
