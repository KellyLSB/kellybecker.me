  title: How To Read Technology Clouds

  body: |
    I decided to use skill clouds to show my expertise and use of a specific technology. I felt that this would help the things I love and have worked with frequently "pop-out" when looking over my resume at a glimpse. There are 5 categories though depending on the section you are viewing they should have different interpretations. Don't worry they are almost the same.

        <p>The technology clouds under work experience show the technologies I used often.</p>

        <ol>
          <li style="color: red;">

          </li>
          <li style="color: grey;">
            Grey, Small Font: Technology was present; extremely little interaction.
