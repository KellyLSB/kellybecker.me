          I had first been introduced to Tioki back when I was working for momentum in 2011. We had Brian and Mandella over for dinner and at that point I knew I would be working for them.

          They flew me out to Oakland for a hack-a-thon in July on 2012. They knew I did not know ruby and having just landed back in Denver from an interview in San Francisco; I did the crazy thing anyone would do. I hopped immediately back on a plane. During the flight I studied up on Ruby, did the Ruby Koans and by the end of the flight I had completed a Rails blog complete with user authentication, user comments and basic moderation.

          I spent a week with them and by the end of the week they offered me a job, thus began my California software career.

          I spent a lot of time cleaning up technical debt and building out features. I very quickly took over the Operations side as well. They wanted to switch to EC2, I had recomendede against it due to the cost implecations and the fact that Heroku was working relatively well for us, but we made the switch anyway.

          I implemented out switch using [Rubber](http://github.com/wr0ngway/rubber); a scaling deployment plugin for Capistrano that utilized the Amazon AWS SDK to boot up, provision and install our application with all it's required services automatically.

          Over the course of the end of the year I joined the team on several team outings, hack-a-thons, meetups and presentations at our incubator Imagine K-12. I also spent a great deal of time working with out CTO and teaching him the fundamentals of object oriented programming; it was a unusual situation. In return he taught me parallel parking.

          When our incubator session graduated, I joined the team at the Demo Day and helped pitch our company to investors.

          Unfortunately in early January we were running out of funds and they had to cut everyone's pay. I had to leave as I could no longer afford me housing expenses; so we parted ways.

          I did my best to help them with the time I had from my new job, but they were slowly tanking. They closed up shop later that year.
        summarized!: |
          Tioki hired me on to help them optimize their Rails application and remove as much technical debt as possible, while getting as many features implemented as possible before Imagine K-12 Demo Day.

          We worked like dogs 10 hours a day, 6 days a week to try and reach this goal. I helped with the migration off Heroku and onto EC2 using [Rubber](http://github.com/wr0ngway/rubber); a plugin for Capistrano. This tool essentially combines the ideaologies of Capistrano with full server bootup and provisioning.

          I also got us hooked up with [Cramp](http://cramp.in) as a asynchronous framework for Server Sent Events support and [Graylog 2](http://www.graylog2.org/) for logging of both the application and our EC2 instances.

          Along side my Dev responsabilities I helped pitch our company at the Imagine K-12 Demo Day and also represented our company at edtech meetups and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Hack for Education, hosted by Facebook.
