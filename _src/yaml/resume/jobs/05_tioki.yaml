          I had first been introduced to Tioki back when I was working for momentum in 2011. We had Brian and Mandella over for dinner and at that point I knew I would be working for them.

          They flew me out to Oakland for a hack-a-thon in July on 2012. They knew I did not know ruby and having just landed back in Denver from an interview in San Francisco; I did the crazy thing anyone would do. I hopped immediately back on a plane. During the flight I studied up on Ruby, did the Ruby Koans and by the end of the flight I had completed a Rails blog complete with user authentication, user comments and basic moderation.

          I spent a week with them and by the end of the week they offered me a job, thus began my California software career.

          I spent a lot of time cleaning up technical debt and building out features. I very quickly took over the Operations side as well. They wanted to switch to EC2, I had recomendede against it due to the cost implecations and the fact that Heroku was working relatively well for us, but we made the switch anyway.

          I implemented out switch using [Rubber](http://github.com/wr0ngway/rubber); a scaling deployment plugin for Capistrano that utilized the Amazon AWS SDK to boot up, provision and install our application with all it's required services automatically.

          Over the course of the end of the year I joined the team on several team outings, hack-a-thons, meetups and presentations at our incubator Imagine K-12. I also spent a great deal of time working with out CTO and teaching him the fundamentals of object oriented programming; it was a unusual situation. In return he taught me parallel parking.

          When our incubator session graduated, I joined the team at the Demo Day and helped pitch our company to investors.

          Unfortunately in early January we were running out of funds and they had to cut everyone's pay. I had to leave as I could no longer afford me housing expenses; so we parted ways.

          I did my best to help them with the time I had from my new job, but they were slowly tanking. They closed up shop later that year.
