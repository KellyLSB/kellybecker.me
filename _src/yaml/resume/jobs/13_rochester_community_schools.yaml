        This job was an after school job. Though we only got paid when the schools was rented out it was fun todo regardless.

        We were given many extra curricular classes that lead to actual positions running the theateres. Over the years I got to do everthing for hanging lights, operating spot, running light boards and lighting design.

        It was a fun and an excellent way to kill time. I rewally enjoyed the work. The only reason I didn't seek out the profession was the lack of entertainment jobs available due to most being union and seniority in unions. That and Detroit's job market.
