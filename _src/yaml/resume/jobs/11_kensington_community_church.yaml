        > Kelly is an incredible developer in PHP and more languages. At the time I hired Kelly, it was to create a from-scratch content management system to manage several college age small groups from our church. Kelly put together a site quickly that was better than the overall content manager of our church's entire website. It's still an incredible management tool, and that was 4 years ago with no upgrades. Kelly thinks forward when it comes to coding, and writes the simplest, most scalable web solutions. Kelly is the best coder I have ever worked with, and probably ever will, the way she stays ahead of the game
