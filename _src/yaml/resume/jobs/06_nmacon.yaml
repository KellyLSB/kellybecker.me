        NMA got hold of me through youmacon and the Michigan Anime Convention Association. They wanted to get a license to run ¥ENN, which was the Software I had originally developed for Youmacon as a Ticketing platform and CRM.

        I took over the server administration and some of the pre-convention customer service for them, as well as provided training and on-site customer service the first year.

        I eventually has to stop providing the service as I did not have the time to continue managing it for Youmacon and NMA. So I did not offer the contract when it ended after 2011.
