          TODO
        summarized: |
          At Verschoyle I essentially was an on-call contactor. If something neded done NOW! I was called. The work was primarily writing Word Press plugins or little features here and there in what at the time was Evolution 2.

          I also did some system administration including scaling a MySQL server to a Master-Slave setup on CentOS hosted on the early Rackspace Cloud.
