        I was a Desk / Mail Room Clerk while attending Western. This was during my short term as a College Student. I left this job when Momentum OS, Inc asked me to join them full time.

        The responsibilities were simple. Require all admissions into the Hall sign in and show ID, as well as sorting and dispersing resident mail and packages.

        The hardest thing was telling people "NO" when they tried to convinve me to allow them entry without ID; as well as confiscating Alcohol from minors and excess allowed alcohol from students over 21 (our Hall allowed 1 alcoholic container per person age 21+).
