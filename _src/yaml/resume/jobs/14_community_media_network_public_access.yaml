        At CMN things were straight forward. Show up, have drinks, lounge and talk (non-alcoholic) if take was available. Then we would get to work. We often had 30 - minutes to an hour to run wire and setup cameras; white balance them.
        
        The team was made up of hobbiests and we all were there for the enjoyment of video. That and it may or may not have been fun to pull branks on our color blind director; sadly that would usually end when he turned on the color scope, but we all got a good laugh. Generaly some you he would figure out exactly which filter we put in front of the lens down to the make and model. Damn Mike was amazing.
        
        It was always a break day when he managed to dial me on his rotary phone.
