        As a home schooled child from a poor conservative family. My parents required that I earn all my own spending money and that they themselves tax it. This made it quite difficult to purchase a laptop and start my career.
        
        So I got a job under the table spinning signs and riding my bike through local neighborhood dropping off coupons for my local store.
        
        I kept doing the job until the owner found out; I was under the legal age for working in a kitchen.
