					<a href="#evolutionsdk" kmodal="1">EvolutionSDK (2011 - 2012)</a>
					<p>This SDK came out of years of development experience and much experimenting and research. Every web developer always intends to re-use their code in another application, but often times it's very difficult to do that without a lot of reworking and rebuilding of the original code. We felt that was unacceptable and started looking at our code to see what aspects were completely application agnostic. What we discovered was that over 90% of the application logic could be written completely independent of the end product. So we started building on that idea. Welcome to E3.</p>

					<a href="http://github.com/EvolutionSDK/lhtml">Logical HTML (2011 - 2012)</a>
					<p>Logical HTML is a templating engine designed for making website themes with a format that just about any web developer, designer, and computer specialist knows. Only accepting strict HTML and properly formatted tags, which promotes healthy, productive coding habits. While also opening a small programatic layer. Consider this the C and V in "MCV" architecture.</p>

					<a href="kellylsb.github.com/Confirmation-Code-Generator">Confirmation Code Generator</a>
					<p>This generator encrypts and decrypts ID numbers to and from an Alpha Numeric (A-Z,0-9) Tracking number like code. It then stores a Salt, and a Salt Format ID within the code. When the Code is decrypted it looks for the Salt Format ID which tells the class where it can find the Salt within the Code. The Salt is then extracted from the Code and sent to the decrypter where it is used to determine which decryption key should be used.</p>
